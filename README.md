# Parenthèse

[![CI](https://github.com/IliesAllali/parenthese/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IliesAllali/parenthese/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A family tree you explore like a map, with the photos, videos and voices of each person. Share it with one link and a password: relatives look around without an account and add what they know.

- **License:** source-available under [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](LICENSE). Free to read, modify and self-host for non-commercial use. Not an OSI open source license, see [License](#license).
- **How it was made:** designed and directed by Ilies Allali. Most of the code was written with Claude Code (Anthropic), then reviewed and tested before being published.

## What it does

- One tree per family: people, couples, parent-child links, laid out automatically.
- Memories on each person: photos, videos (a file or a YouTube link), audio recordings to keep a voice, documents, GPS tracks.
- Free annotations on the tree: drawings, stickers, text, photos placed anywhere.
- Sharing by link: each tree has an address `/arbre/<name>` protected by a sharing password. With it, relatives can look around and suggest additions.
- No account needed to visit: someone who receives the link and the password opens the tree directly.
- Reviewed contributions: the owner chooses whether the family's changes apply right away or go through a review queue, where each change is approved or declined.
- GEDCOM import and export, to come from another program or leave for one (the export holds the people and their links, not the media files).
- English and French interface. It follows the browser's language, with a switch in the app, and `?lang=en` or `?lang=fr` in the address forces one.

## The promise

- Free, and it will stay free.
- Your data stays yours: no ads, nothing sold. What the app records and why is on the [Data and privacy](https://parenthese.io/en/privacy/) page.
- Self-hostable: the code is public, and a family can run its own instance on a server or a NAS without depending on anyone.

## Self-hosting

Requirement: Docker with the Compose plugin (`docker compose version` must answer).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IliesAllali/parenthese.git
cd parenthese
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the two empty values:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: a password for the database (letters and digits only).
- `JWT_SECRET`: a long random key. To generate one: `openssl rand -base64 48` or `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"`.

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first start builds the images, applies the database migrations, then serves the app on [http://localhost](http://localhost). Create your account from the home screen. The first account is an account like any other, there is no global administrator.

Three containers run: `db` (PostgreSQL 16), `api` (the Node API) and `web` (nginx, which serves the front end and proxies the API). Only `web` is exposed, on the port set by `WEB_PORT` (80 by default). If that port is taken, change `WEB_PORT` in `.env` and update `CORS_ORIGIN` to match.

To open the instance to your family over the Internet, put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of the `web` port (Caddy, Traefik, nginx) and set the public address in `CORS_ORIGIN`, for example `https://tree.your-domain.com`.

A self-hosted instance sends no analytics. Usage tracking on parenthese.io only turns on when a PostHog key is provided at build time, which this setup does not do.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api     # API log
docker compose ps              # container status
docker compose down            # stop, data is kept
```

To check that an installation works end to end, run `bash tools/docker-smoke.sh http://localhost` (add the port if `WEB_PORT` is not 80). The script needs `curl` and `jq`. It goes through the web port like a browser: home page, API health, account creation, sign-in, creating then deleting a test tree. The test account (`smoke-...@example.com`) stays in the database.

### Where the data lives

Two Docker volumes, kept across restarts and updates:

- `parenthese_db-data`: the PostgreSQL database (people, links, accounts, contributions).
- `parenthese_media`: the uploaded files (photos, videos, audio, documents).

### Backups

With Docker, a backup takes two commands, run from the repository folder:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U parenthese -Fc parenthese > parenthese-db-$(date +%F).dump
docker run --rm -v parenthese_media:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine tar -czf /backup/parenthese-media-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /data .
```

Adjust `-U parenthese` and the database name if you changed `POSTGRES_USER` or `POSTGRES_DB`. To restore the database, run `docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U parenthese -d parenthese --clean < parenthese-db-YYYY-MM-DD.dump`, then extract the media archive into the volume with the same `docker run` command, using `tar -xzf` instead of `-czf`.

The `deploy/backup.sh` script does the same (PostgreSQL dump, media archive, checksums, rotation, optional S3 upload) for an installation without Docker. It reads `backend/.env` and needs `pg_dump` on the machine. It is configured through the `BACKUP_ROOT`, `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` and `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` variables.

### Updating

```bash
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Database migrations apply on their own when the API starts. Make a backup first, as a habit.

## Development

The repository holds three Node projects: `backend/` (Fastify, Prisma, PostgreSQL, TypeScript), `frontend/` (React, Vite) and `landing/` (the marketing site, not needed to run the app). The Docker images use Node 24.

### Backend

```bash
npm --prefix backend install
npm --prefix backend run db:bootstrap
npm --prefix backend run dev
```

`db:bootstrap` starts a portable PostgreSQL on Windows (database `genealogy`, user `postgres`, port 5432). The binaries must already be extracted in `backend/.local/postgresql_full/pgsql`, the script does not download them. On other systems any local PostgreSQL works: set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` (template in `backend/.env.example`) and create the schema with `npm --prefix backend run prisma:migrate`.

On any system with Docker, a throwaway database replaces `db:bootstrap`:

```bash
docker run -d --name parenthese-dev-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=genealogy postgres:16
npm --prefix backend run prisma:deploy
npm --prefix backend run dev
```

Before `prisma:deploy`, `backend/.env` must exist (a copy of `backend/.env.example`) with `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/genealogy"`, matching those credentials. `docker stop parenthese-dev-db` stops the database, `docker start parenthese-dev-db` restarts it with its data.

The API listens on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and answers `{ "ok": true }` on `/health`.

### Frontend

Create `frontend/.env.development.local`:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=
VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:4000
VITE_DEV_PROXY_STRIP_API=1
```

Then:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend install
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

The Vite server proxies `/api`, `/trees`, `/auth` and `/health` to the local API and strips the `/api` prefix, as nginx does in production. Without this file, the front end calls `http://localhost:4000` directly and shared links under `/api/arbre/...` return 404.

### Translations

Interface text goes through `t()` from `frontend/src/i18n/index.js`. The French text is the key, and the English lives in `frontend/src/i18n/en/*.js`. A missing English entry falls back to French, and a test fails if any text passed to `t()` has no English entry.

### Tests

```bash
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix backend test
```
